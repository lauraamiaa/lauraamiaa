### Hey  ðŸ‘‹  I'm Laura!

This year I decided to switch my career and enter the programming world. As a freshly graduated [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com/) student, I have become a trained full-stack developer in only two months.

### My Last Projects:

#### :coffee: Guji Webshop
For my Codaisseur portfolio full-stack project I build a webshop for a coffee roastery. The front-end is created with JavaScript, React, Redux and CSS, and the back-end with an Express server, JWT & Bcrypt authentication and a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM. I have furthermore integrated PayPal as a payment method. 

#### :smirk_cat: Bark Back 
This project was created within a five-day group challenge. Shedding light on verbal street harassment, this full-stack project allows the user to respond with fierce comebacks to catcalls. Using JavaScript, React, Redux and CSS, and integrating the Web Speech API, this web app allows to recreate catcalling scenes and submit catcalls. The back-end was built using Express and PostgreSQL.
